# Dark Energy Survey - Data Release 2 (DES DR2)


   
## Description  

(paragraph extracted from the DES [DES Data Management website](https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/home))


_"The DES is a 5000 square degree grizY photometric survey of the Southern sky aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion rate of the universe using four complementary methods: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. DES uses the new 3 square degree Dark Energy Camera (DECam) imager, a 570 Megapixel CCD camera installed at the prime focus of on the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in northern Chile. For about 100 nights per year, from 2013 until 2019, the DECam scanned the sky to perform a 5000 sq-degree wide field survey and 30 sq-degree supernova survey. Learn more on the main DES website."_ 

## Tables 

### DES DR2 Main (des.dr2_main)

(paragraph adapted from the [DES DR2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05765))


_"DR2_MAIN includes all the main quantities extracted from the coadd pipeline and important information about the objects. That table also includes MAG_AUTO and WAVG_MAG_PSF, associated uncertainties, as well as the corresponding dereddened magnitudes along with star/galaxy separation columns."_
