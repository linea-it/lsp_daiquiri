# Gaia - Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3)


   
## Description  

(paragraph extracted from the [Gaia DR3 release page](https://gaia.aip.de/cms/data/gdr3/))  

_"Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) was released on 13th of June 2022. The data are available through the Gaia Archive (and through the partner data centres). The Gaia DR3 catalogue builds upon the Early Data Release 3 (released on 3 December 2020) and combines, for the same stretch of time and the same set of observations, these already-published data products, with numerous new data products such as extended objects and non-single stars."_

_"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The third Gaia data release, Gaia DR3, contains the astrometry and broad-band photometry already published as part of Gaia EDR3 and introduces a large variety of new data products:

* A much expanded radial velocity survey, as well as magnitudes of sources in the GRVS  band, and a spectral line broadening parameter vbroad;
* Mean BP, RP, and RVS spectra for a large subset of sources;
* A much expanded collection of variable sources, covering 24 variability types;
* Photometric time series for all variable sources;
* The Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey which contains the photometric time series for all sources (variable and non-variable) in a 5.5 deg radius field around M31;
* Object classification, including a self-organised map (SOM) of poorly classified sources;
* Astrophysical parameters (APs) from mean BP/RP spectra, including Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples;
* Astrophysical parameters from mean RVS spectra;
* Chemical abundances from mean RVS spectra;
* Diffuse interstellar band parameters from mean RVS spectra;
* Non-single star solutions;
* QSO and galaxy candidates, including redshifts, QSO host detections, and QSO host and galaxy light profiles;
* Solar system objects (SSO), including reflectance spectra derived from epoch BP/RP spectra;
* Total galactic extinction maps at various HEALPix levels;
* Archived photometric science alerts.
